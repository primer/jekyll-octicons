# :warning: This repo is deprecated!
We've moved all of the Octicons modules to a [single repository][repo]. You can still install and update `jekyll-octicons` with rubygems, but its [code] and [issues] now live elsewhere.

[repo]: https://github.com/primer/octicons
[issues]: https://github.com/primer/octicons/issues
[code]: https://github.com/primer/octicons/tree/master/lib/jekyll-octicons
